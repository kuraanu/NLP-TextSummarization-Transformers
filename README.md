# NLP-TextSummarization-Transformers
Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models struggle to distinguish between essential and redundant information when analyzing large volumes of text. However, the advent of transformer-based models has marked a significant breakthrough in NLP. These models allow for simultaneous processing of entire sequences of text, resulting in more efficient and accurate language understanding.

One prominent application of transformer-based models is in text summarization, where the goal is to condense text while retaining key information. This process offers several advantages, including efficient information comprehension, time-saving for readers, and the facilitation of aggregating news, blog posts, or research papers. Summarization enables individuals to stay informed without the need for extensive reading.

Text summarization techniques can be categorized into two main approaches: extractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization involves selecting and presenting important sentences or passages from the original text, while abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences that capture the essence of the text in a condensed form.

Regarding the dataset used for this study, it was obtained from Kaggle and comprises articles from CNN and the DailyMail. The dataset includes over 300,000 news articles written by journalists, with CNN articles spanning from April 2007 to 2015 and Daily Mail articles from June 2010 to April 2015.
